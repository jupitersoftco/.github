# Jupiter Software GitHub Profile Repository

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Profile Changes

**DO NOT make profile changes to this file!**

The GitHub profile content is located in:

```
profile/README.md
```

## What This Repository Contains

This is a special GitHub repository that contains the profile README for Jupiter Software. The repository structure is:

- `profile/README.md` - **The actual profile content** (this is what shows on the GitHub profile)
- `README.md` (this file) - Repository documentation only
- `assets/` - Images and assets used in the profile

## Making Profile Updates

To update the Jupiter Software GitHub profile:

1. Edit `profile/README.md` (NOT this file)
2. All profile content, styling, and information goes there
3. Changes to this root README.md will NOT appear on the profile

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as the source for the Jupiter Software organization's GitHub profile page. It follows GitHub's special repository naming convention for organization profiles.
