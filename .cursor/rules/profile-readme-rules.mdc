# Profile README Rules

## üö® CRITICAL: Profile README Location

**ALL changes to the GitHub profile README MUST go into `profile/README.md`**

### Why This Matters

- The `profile/README.md` file is what displays on the GitHub profile page
- The root `README.md` file is NOT used for the profile display
- Making changes to the root `README.md` will have NO EFFECT on the profile

### File Structure Rules

#### ‚úÖ DO: Make changes here

```
profile/README.md
```

- This is the ONLY file that affects the GitHub profile display
- All profile content, updates, and modifications go here
- This file is automatically displayed on the GitHub profile

#### ‚ùå DON'T: Make changes here

```
README.md (root)
```

- This file should contain only basic repository information
- Should have clear warnings about not making profile changes here
- Should redirect users to the correct location

### Root README.md Guidelines

The root README.md should contain:

- Brief explanation of what this repository is for
- Clear warning that profile changes go in `profile/README.md`
- Basic navigation instructions
- Nothing more - keep it minimal and focused

### Enforcement

- Always check file location before making profile-related changes
- If someone tries to edit root README.md for profile content, redirect them
- Maintain the separation between repository documentation and profile content

## Summary

**Remember: `profile/README.md` = GitHub profile display, `README.md` = repository info only**
